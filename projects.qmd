# Projects & Experience

Here are some highlights of my project and work experience.

## Project: Type II Diabetes Prediction Report

**Objective:**\
Predict the risk of Type II Diabetes using electronic health records.

**Methods:**\
- Analyzed health data for 100,000 patients (with class balancing) using logistic regression and gradient boosting machines (GBM).\
- Investigated key predictors including BMI, age, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level, and evaluated interaction effects (e.g., BMI \* Age).

**Findings:**\
- GBM outperformed the logistic regression model in terms of accuracy and AUC.\
- A statistically significant interaction between BMI and age was found, highlighting compounded risk factors.

**Conclusion:**\
The study recommends the GBM model for more accurate diabetes risk prediction and suggests future work to incorporate additional predictors and further refine the model.

## Project: Regression Model for Mobile Phone Price Predictions

**Objective:**\
Develop a regression model to predict smartphone prices based on various device features.

**Methods:**\
- Utilized a Kaggle dataset containing features such as Ratings, RAM, ROM, Mobile Size, Camera resolutions, and Battery Power.\
- Applied power transformations to predictors and a log transformation to the price.\
- Compared several models using metrics like R², AIC, BIC, and mean squared error (MSE) to select the best-performing model.

**Findings:**\
- The transformed regression model (log(Price) with power-transformed predictors) achieved the highest R² and the lowest MSE among tested models.

**Conclusion:**\
This final model robustly predicts mobile phone prices and underscores the importance of product ratings and technical specifications in price determination.

## Project: Effect of Musical Instrument Training on Mental Arithmetic Abilities

**Objective:**\
Examine how playing different musical instruments and varying practice durations affect mental arithmetic performance.

**Methods:**\
- Conducted a two-way randomized block design with islander participants, grouped by age (teenagers: 13–17, young adults: 18–30).\
- Participants were assigned to control or one of three instrument groups (Piano, Flute, Cello) with two practice durations (10 vs. 20 minutes).\
- Data were analyzed using ANOVA, interaction plots, and post-hoc Tukey HSD tests.

**Findings:**\
- Significant interactions were observed between the type of musical instrument and practice duration on arithmetic score improvements.\
- Certain instruments (e.g., cello) produced more pronounced benefits, while practice duration alone did not show a significant effect.

**Conclusion:**\
Musical training—particularly with specific instruments—can enhance mental arithmetic abilities. The study suggests that integrating music into educational practices may improve cognitive performance, warranting further investigation.
